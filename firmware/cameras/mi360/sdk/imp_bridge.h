/*
 * IMP 1.1.2 graph adapter. Caller must first verify the exact SDK
 * and provider hashes and establish exclusive ownership of the camera's media hardware.
 * libm and libalog load GLOBAL before the SDK; all strong SDK imports and their
 * actual GOT slots are checked before ISP initialization. No application logger
 * substitutes are exported. No audio, OSD, JPEG, IR or motor APIs are used. Calls are serialized internally;
 * overlapping calls fail rather than wait. Do not fork while a handle is open.
 *
 * open: 0 returns one handle; -1 leaves *handle NULL and describes the failure.
 * next: 0 copies one SDK frame into caller-owned dst; 1 is a nonzero result from
 *       the finite 100 ms SDK poll (its actual code is in error); -1 is fatal.
 *       capacity must be 1..1048576. On nonzero return length/timestamp are zero
 *       unless an overlapping call is rejected before touching those outputs.
 *       dst and output/error buffers must be valid, disjoint caller allocations.
 * close: consumes the handle exactly once, returns 0 on complete cleanup or -1.
 *
 * Never call next after a fatal result. Always close a successfully opened handle,
 * including after next fails. A cleanup/release failure can leave SDK owners alive:
 * close then retains internal storage/library and reports POISONED/reboot required.
 * A failed acquisition has uncertified failure atomicity: open/next then retains
 * shared graph parents and the library rather than guess a paired teardown.
 * A failed open unwinds only when ownership is certain; it can poison this process. Do not
 * retry an open after that diagnostic. External restoration/reboot is caller-owned.
 * Finite polling does not bound other SDK/kernel calls or guarantee driver health.

 * Integer channel FPS1..20; sensor mode remains the qualified native20fps.
 * Main bitrate32..2048, sub32..512: initial target kbit/s. The exact SDK helper
 * derives its maximum/allocated ceiling (approximately4/3 target); later scalar
