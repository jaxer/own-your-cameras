/* Exact Mi360 IMP ABI: 16 kHz, signed little-endian PCM16, mono, 640 samples.
 * The caller owns an initialized exclusive IMP System session and a loader
 * which has pinned/qualified all SDK imports and actual GOT bindings. sdk is a
 * borrowed dlopen handle, not a second SDK instance. No Init/Exit/dlopen/dlclose
 * occurs here. All handles/providers MUST outlive this audio owner, including
 * after POISONED. No video teardown/System_Exit while audio owners survive.
 *
 * DSP effects require a borrowed, pinned, preloaded/import-qualified
 * libaudioProcess.so handle (including its libstdc++/math dependencies). AEC
 * starts disabled; aec() explicitly enables it. AEC opens three /tmp PCM dump
 * files; /tmp/app enables writes. The external speaker amplifier is caller-owned.
 * Stock gain/volume defaults are requested, not independently verified: stock
 * SetGain can mask hardware failure and getters are cached.
 *
 * Initialize *handle=NULL before open; never overwrite an existing handle.
 * Caller allocations must be valid and disjoint for the full call; next dst
 * capacity is at least1280, with writable length/timestamp and error buffers.
 * 0 success; 1 next has no frame / play has no free block; -1 terminal operation
 * failure/invalid arguments; -2 uncertain live SDK ownership, process poisoned.
 * Bound all caller retries: GetFrame's -1 is not a distinct EAGAIN contract.
 * next publishes length/timestamp only after release succeeds; dst can have
 * unpublished bytes after release failure. SDK-owned original frame released
 * exactly once. play takes exactly1280 bytes and copies before SDK SendFrame.
 *
 * Calls are serialized internally by a nonwaiting gate. next/play after any
 * terminal hardware error are rejected until close. close consumes *handle,
 * attempts each independent known stage once, and retains uncertain owners.
 * No PollingFrame/Flush/sleep/retry loops. SDK mutex/ioctl/disable calls can still
 * block: there is NO honest hard wall-time bound in an in-process C adapter.
 * The media supervisor supplies deadline/escalation; never cancel an FFI thread
 * and unload its code. Do not fork while open. A poisoned failed open leaves
 * *handle NULL and blocks future opens; its shared owner must remain alive.
