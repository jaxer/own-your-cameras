# Reolink E1 Zoom firmware

Local video and two-way audio over RTSP, pan/tilt/zoom, autofocus, day/night controls
and Home Assistant discovery over MQTT. Uses the camera's stock kernel and drivers.

**Supported:** E1 Zoom · IPC_566SD664M5MP · stock firmware v3.1.0.4417_2412122178.

## Get started

1. [Get root SSH access](../../../docs/devices/reolink-e1-zoom/root-access.md) and keep your NAND backup.
2. [Build the firmware](docs/build.md).
3. [Configure and install](docs/install.md).

## Use

```yaml
streams:
  e1zoom:
    - rtsp://USER:PASSWORD@CAMERA_IP:554/Preview_01_main
  e1zoom_sub:
    - rtsp://USER:PASSWORD@CAMERA_IP:554/Preview_01_sub
```

Main video defaults to 1920×1440; sub video is 640×480. Both include 16 kHz AAC audio.
go2rtc handles the PCMU talkback channel. Connect Home Assistant to your MQTT broker to discover
controls and settings; see [configuration and entities](docs/home-assistant.md).

## Recover

```sh
ssh root@CAMERA_IP 'rm -f /mnt/para/cam.enabled; sync; reboot'
```

This returns to the vendor firmware and keeps settings. Three failed starts also select vendor
firmware. For reset-button recovery and its data loss, see [recovery](docs/recovery.md).
