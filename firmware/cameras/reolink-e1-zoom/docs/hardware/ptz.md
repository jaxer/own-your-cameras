# Pan/tilt: the MS32006 stepper controller

Register map, units and homing of the pan/tilt stepper controller as driven by `cam::ptz` (`cam/src/ptz/`).
Tags as in [README.md](README.md#evidence-tags).

## Bus

- `/dev/i2c-2`, 7-bit address **0x10** [D `ms32006_init` @ 0xfa020]: `ioctl(I2C_TENBIT, 0)`, then
  `ioctl(I2C_SLAVE_FORCE, 0x10)`. Pinmux for the bus is set at boot by `vg_boot.sh`, nothing for us to do.
- Every access is an SMBus **I2C block transfer** (`ioctl(I2C_SMBUS=0x720)`, size 8, `read_write` 1/0, `command` =
  register, data block = length byte + payload, payload ≤ 31 bytes) [D `_ms32006_i2c_read` @ 0xf94ec,
  `_ms32006_i2c_write` @ 0xf9608]. `busybox i2cget/i2cset/i2cdump -f 2 0x10` hit the same registers [V].
- The register file is 0x00–0x0f; 0x80–0xff mirror it (`i2cdump` rows 0x00 and 0x80 are identical) [V]. The vendor
  reads the status block at the mirror 0x8b/0x8d; we do the same.
- The vendor `device` owns the chip while it runs (its `_ms32006_proc` thread polls it). Stop it (or kill the
  stack) before using `cam ptz`, and keep the hardware watchdog fed: with `device` gone the camera reboots after
  roughly 20–60 s [V, it happened twice].

## Registers

Two identical banks: **pan = bank 0x00**, **tilt = bank 0x04**. `b` is the bank base.

| Reg | Bits | Meaning | Evidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| 0x00 | 0 | chip enable: reset is `0x00` then `0x01`, then `usleep(50 ms)` | D `_ms32006_reset` @ 0xf97f0 |
| 0x00 | 7 | motor type, set to 1 at init (`_ms32006_set_motor_type(1)` RMW) | D @ 0xf9888 |
| 0x00 | 2 / 1 | **stop** pan / tilt: halts that axis' pulses. Cleared before every move, set by stop | D `_ms32006_move` @ 0xfa510, `_ms32006_stop` @ 0xfb070; V (`cam ptz stop` → 0x87) |
| `b`+1 | 7:0 | step-rate divisor, low byte | D `_ms32006_set_pps` @ 0xf9d9c |
| `b`+2 | 5:0 | divisor bits 13:8 | D, same |
| `b`+2 | 7 | drive mode (`_ms32006_set_drv_mode(axis, 0)` sets it; mode ≠ 0 clears bits 7:6) | D @ 0xf9f2c |
| `b`+3 | 7:0 | steps to move, low byte | D `_ms32006_move` |
| `b`+4 | 3:0 | steps bits 11:8 (move length is 12 bits: **max 4095 per command**) | D, V |
| `b`+4 | 6 | direction bit | D, V |
| `b`+4 | 7 | set on every move command (`0x80 \| dir<<6 \| steps>>8`) | D, V |
| 0x09 | 7 / 6 | **kick** pan / tilt: starts the programmed move; self-clears (reads 0 afterwards) | D (RMW `\| 0x80`/`0x40` after programming) @ 0xfa6dc, 0xfafb0; V |
| 0x09 | 3, 2 | IR-cut drive: the vendor writes 8 / 4 / 0 here in 300 ms pulses (`@ 0xf96f0`, `@ 0xf9750`); driven by `cam::ir`, see [ir.md](ir.md) | D |
| 0x0b / 0x0d | 4 | **busy**: 1 while pan / tilt pulses are being output | D `_ms32006_get_cur_status` @ 0xfa250, V |
| 0x0b / 0x0d | 3:0 + next reg | 12-bit step counter: counts steps issued since power-on, **saturates at 0xfff**, not a position | V (0x64, 0xc8, 0x1f4 after 100, 100, 300 steps; 0xfff after more) |
| 0x0b / 0x0d | 7 | reads 1, no function found | V |

Step rate: `divisor = (15 000 000 / pps) >> 7`. The vendor programs **600 pps** (divisor 195 = 0xc3, the value
found in reg 0x01/0x05 on a running camera) and has 1200 pps as its fast rate [D, runtime memory of `device`].
A 4095-step chunk takes about 6.8 s at 600 pps; measured full pan travel (7460 steps with margin) 12 s [V].

Registers 0x0a, 0x0c–0x0f and everything above 0x10 read 0 (apart from the 0x80 mirror) [V].

### Power-on state left by the vendor [V]

`i2cdump`: `81 c3 80 xx xx c3 80 xx xx 00 00 xx xx xx` for registers 0x00–0x0d. `cam::ptz` `init` writes the
same values (test `init_programs_the_registers_the_vendor_leaves_behind`).

## Move sequence (per axis chunk)

1. write `b`+3 ← `steps & 0xff`
2. write `b`+4 ← `0x80 | dir<<6 | steps>>8`
3. reg 0x00 ← reg 0x00 with this axis' stop bit cleared (RMW)
4. reg 0x09 ← reg 0x09 | this axis' kick bit (RMW)
5. poll reg 0x8b / 0x8d bit 4 until clear (the driver polls every 10 ms)

The two axes run independently: the driver starts both before it waits for either.

## Coordinates, travel and homing

- Travel from the vendor's per-axis table (runtime memory of `device`, struct stride 0xac, field +0xec): **pan
  7360 steps, tilt 1240 steps** [D/V]. 7360 steps is nearly a full turn: the head sees the same objects at both ends.
- **No optocoupler is readable from Linux on this unit** [V/I]: every MS32006 register the vendor touches is in
  the table above (all `i2c_read/write` call sites in `device` were checked), none holds a sensor level; the
  vendor's GPIO edge-poll table for the optocouplers is present but disabled (`enable` = 0 for both axes in the
  live process), and the only candidate sysfs GPIOs (100, 104, plus 9, 224, 225, 232, 233) never changed during
  full sweeps. The `OptocouplerPos` strings in `device` serve other motor types. So the vendor homes
  **open-loop against the mechanical end stop** (it overdrives by 100 steps, `+100`/`-100` in the state
  machine @ 0xfb64c), and so do we.
- Directions [V, from frames]: pan x grows with direction bit **0**, so the pan stop is at x = 0 with direction
  bit **1**; tilt y grows with direction bit **1**, the tilt stop is at y = 0 with bit **0**.
- `home`: pan 7360+100 steps with bit 1, tilt 1240+100 steps with bit 0, both at once. Afterwards the driver's
  position is (0, 0). `goto(x, y)` then moves the difference. The driver keeps the position only inside one
  process: every `cam ptz` invocation that moves homes first (12 s from anywhere).
- Check against the vendor: homing, then pan x = 6195 and tilt y = 650, gives the pose the vendor stack ends in at
  boot (`default_x=6195`, `default_y=650` in `/mnt/para/0_ptz.cfg`), frame for frame.
  The same manual register sequence was used for that frame as `cam ptz move 6195 650` runs.

## Presets

`/mnt/para/0_ptz.cfg` is one XML element with attributes `bval<N>` (slot used), `pos<N>_x` (pan steps),
`pos<N>_y` (tilt steps). Unused slots have `bval="0"` and are refused. `cam ptz preset <n>` reads slot `n` and moves there after a home.

## `cam ptz`

```
cam ptz [--dev /dev/i2c-2] [--cfg /mnt/para/0_ptz.cfg] home | move <pan> <tilt> | stop | preset <n>
```

`stop` from a second process is owner-mediated: the serialized hardware owner abandons the
entire active move or home, discards queued motion, and invalidates position until a successful
home. It acknowledges only after the hardware stop call for both axes returns successfully.
The request bypasses the ownership locks; a two-second caller timeout reports failure, never
"stopped". The local mode-0600 `cam-controls.stop` Unix datagram endpoint lives next to the runtime
lock. With no active owner, the command takes the locks and stops both axes directly.
MQTT `camera/<id>/stop/set = PRESS` uses the same owner and reports `stop/state` as `stopped`
or `error`. Retained stop commands are ignored. Unknown pan/tilt states clear retained coordinates.

## Speed profile and repeatability [V]

`cam::ptz::Profile { start_pps, max_pps, ramp }`: each leg starts at `start_pps`, rises linearly to
`max_pps` over `ramp` and brakes symmetrically before its target (`v² = start² + 2·a·d`). Chunks are
~100 ms while ramping or holding and one long chunk at cruise; the rate is written between chunks
(writing the divisor during a busy chunk has **no effect**: a 1200-step chunk at 600 pps took 2009 ms
with or without a 1200 pps write at 0.5 s). The gap from "idle seen" to the next kick is 3–7 ms.
Homing always uses the vendor 600 pps with no ramp (`Profile::homing()`).

Repeatability: a frame of `Preview_01_main` (1920×1440) at (6195, 650), 10 round trips
(3262, 739) ↔ (6195, 650) at the rate, a frame at (6195, 650) again, phase-correlation shift (the RAM probe
`cam/examples/probe90.rs`, stock stack stopped, ≈1 step per pixel horizontally):

| Max pps | Ramp (start, time) | Drift px (x, y) | 10 trips |
|---|---|---|---|
| 600 | 200, 0.8 s | −1.4, 1.0 / −0.1, −0.1 | 114 s |
| 800 | 200, 0.8 s | −3.6, 0.1 | 91 s |
| 900 | 200, 0.8 s | −3.6, −0.2 / −3.4, −0.1 | 84 s |
| 1000 | 200, 0.8 s | −6.0, −0.2 | 77 s |
| 1100 | 200, 0.8 s | −21.5, −0.1 | 72 s |
| 1200 / 1800 / 2400 | 200, 0.8 s | −88 / −147 / −165 | 68 / 52 / 44 s |
| 800 | 300, 1.5 s | −1.9, −0.1 | 104 s |
| **900** | **300, 1.5 s** | **−0.4, −0.0** | 97 s |
| 1000 | 300, 1.5 s | −13.8, −0.1 | 91 s |

The vendor's 1200 pps "fast" rate loses steps on this unit. The highest rate without measurable drift
(≤ 3 px) is 900 pps with the gentle ramp, so `PTZ_MAX_PPS` (`ptz::MAX_PPS`) = 900 / 1.25 = **720**, and
the first-run profile is 300 → 720 pps over 1.5 s (`ptz_start_speed` 300, `ptz_ramp` 1500 ms: the
measured passing shape; the 200 → 800 pps ramp drifted at 800–900).
Full pan travel (home to 7360) after homing: 13.1 s at 600, 10.1 s at 800, 8.3 s at 1000 pps (ramped).
