# Audio: microphone, speaker and the amplifier

`cam serve` captures 16 kHz mono AAC-LC from the microphone and plays signed 16-bit mono samples on the speaker,
inside the video pipeline's HDAL session and common memory. Both RTSP paths share one microphone hub and one
exclusive PCMU backchannel ([../architecture.md](../architecture.md#rtsp)). The RTSP server starts only after audio
startup succeeds; shutdown stops audio before common memory is torn down, and a failed start releases everything it
acquired. Tags as in [README.md](README.md#evidence-tags).

## Stock settings [D]

Stock `device` at `0x8f0f4..0x8f194` opens capture at 16 kHz, 16 bit, mono, 1,024 samples, 10 frames.
ANR is `(enabled=1, suppress=30, HPF=160, bias=9)`. The AEC maximum settings are `(enabled=1, leak_enabled=0,
leak_value=99, noise=-60, echo=-60, filter_length=1024, frame_size=128, notch_radius=992, loopback=left)`; stock
also has a model-47 branch that picks noise −30, and the model predicate was not resolved, so `cam` uses the
generic −60. The stock runtime setter at `0x8f4d4..0x8f52c` uses the same filter, frame and notch values. The
kernel accepts these parameters [V]; that does not prove acoustic echo suppression.

**AEC has no reference signal.** `lb_channel=left` names the capture channel that carries the speaker loopback,
but capture is one channel (`mode=1`) with a zeroed `DRV_CONFIG`, so nothing is mixed in. The stock
`DRV_CONFIG` contents were not recovered. Until a recording with the speaker playing shows the echo with AEC on
and off, treat the microphone path as having no echo reference. No loopback route is added: an unverified one
could change the frame layout the AAC encoder consumes.

## Capture

Capture binds directly to `hd_audioenc` with `aac_adts=0`. Each raw access unit and its encoder PTS are copied
once into the audio hub, and both RTSP paths packetize it as RFC 3640. The bitstream region is mapped once,
cache-invalidated before reads and bounds-checked, and every pulled descriptor is released, also on the
copy and cache failure paths.

## Speaker

Samples go through a 2,048-byte physical staging buffer from `hd_common_mem_alloc`, flushed before the
non-blocking `hd_audioout_push_in_buf`; no Rust heap pointer reaches an HDAL descriptor. The staging buffer is
reusable as soon as the push returns [D]: `isf_audout_inputport_push_imgbuf_to_dest` (`kflow_audioout.ko`
`0x1748`) calls `wavstudio_push_buf_to_queue`, which (`kflow_audiocap.ko` `0x37f0`) copies the bytes into its own
ring at `0x3940` before returning. A full buffer counts as dropped samples; other failures propagate.

Stock allocates 60 output frames (`device` `0x8fe68`); `cam` uses eight. Three frames dropped about 40 % of
paced samples, eight dropped none on the same recording [V]. That is allocation capacity, not a measured
playback latency.

The hardware loop waits at most 10 ms for video, polls one AAC unit without waiting, and drains one fresh
talkback packet per iteration in blocks of at most 1,024 samples. The RTSP side keeps a five-packet queue
with 100 ms expiry, one exclusive talker, and clears it on disconnect.

### Amplifier: GPIO 234

The codec output alone is too weak for the speaker. Stock talkback drives GPIO **234** high during playback
and low afterwards [V, syscall trace of the stock `device`]. With the same voice clip replayed and recorded by
the camera's own microphone, speech correlation was 0.094 with GPIO 234 low, 0.532 with it high and 0.553 on
stock [V].

`Sys::with_speaker_enable` takes the sysfs GPIO adapter. Speaker startup first drives it low, enables it once
HDAL and the staging memory are ready, and keeps it high for the output graph's lifetime; teardown mutes it
before releasing HDAL. A failed enable mutes and unwinds; a failed mute still releases every HDAL resource and
ends the session. Without the GPIO the adapter refuses to start the speaker.

## Tuning at runtime

Every audio parameter is a setting ([../settings.md](../settings.md)): mic and speaker volume, AEC on/off with
noise, echo, notch and leak, ANR on/off with suppression, high-pass cutoff and bias. `hdal::audio::Tuning::stock()`
holds the stock values (AEC and ANR on, mic 80 as stock sets it through ctrl item `0x19001`, speaker 100). The
`DEV_CONFIG` `aec_max`/`anr_max` envelope always stays stock.

- **Live sets do not take effect** [V]. On a running capture, `hd_audiocap_set(OUT_AEC/OUT_ANR)` on the i/o path
  and `VOLUME` on the ctrl path return 0, but 20 s quiet-room captures were unchanged (−47.9/−48.0/−48.1 dBFS RMS
  for mic 100/50/100, −48.0 with ANR on). Stock also re-opens the capture for every AEC/ANR change.
- **So the media thread restarts the capture path** between loop iterations; video, the sub stream and the
  speaker keep running. The same settings then change the capture by up to 23 dB (ANR on −38.9 vs off −24.6 dBFS
  RMS) [V]. The room was not acoustically controlled: this shows the settings take effect, not good values.
- Speaker volume is a live ctrl-path set on the running output, no restart.
- **Mic and speaker volume are accepted but change nothing measurable** [V]. A camera recording replayed at
  +12 dB through the backchannel and recorded from `Preview_01_sub` (peaks −4…−6 dBFS, no clipping) gave
  −23.1…−24.6 dBFS for mic 100 and 30, and −24.4/−24.5 dBFS for speaker 100 and 40, whether the capture volume
  was set before or after the i/o path opened.
- A start the driver refuses falls back to the previous tuning, and the state reports what runs. If that also
  fails, capture is down and it is a media error. At boot a refused persisted tuning is retried once with
  `Tuning::stock()`.
- Kernel limits (`kflow_audiocap.ko` strings): bias is clamped to 1–9, a volume above 100 becomes 100. Suppression
  3–35 and high-pass 0–1000 Hz are the ranges exercised on the camera; nothing outside them is established, so the
  settings clamp there.
- ABI: audiocap set `VOLUME` (id 9) is a one-word ctrl-path set (`hd_audiocap_set` @ `0xdddc` → kflow item
  `0x19001`), listed in `hdal-sys/abi/libhdal-2.00-param-sizes.tsv`.

## Checking it on a camera

`make device-serve CAMERA=<ssh host> AUTH=<file with user:password>` runs `cam serve --diagnostic` in RAM with the
vendor stack stopped and reboots afterwards ([../development.md](../development.md)); the diagnostic serves on
port 8554, the installed daemon on 554. While it runs, `ffprobe`
both paths over TCP: H.264 plus AAC-LC, 16,000 Hz, one channel. Record the microphone:

```sh
ffmpeg -rtsp_transport tcp -i 'rtsp://USER:PASSWORD@CAMERA_IP:8554/Preview_01_sub' \
  -map 0:a:0 -t 3 -c:a copy mic.aac
```

Play a recording on the speaker through the backchannel (the tool reads the credentials from the file and
never prints them):

```sh
ffmpeg -i speech.wav -ar 8000 -ac 1 -f mulaw speech.pcmu
python3 -I scripts/audio_backchannel.py --host CAMERA_IP --port 8554 --auth AUTH_FILE speech.pcmu
```

The sender negotiates DESCRIBE → SETUP of track 2 → PLAY, sends 20 ms PCMU RTP packets with TCP NODELAY, then
TEARDOWN; it accepts either path. Sent bytes × 2 should equal the daemon's `speaker_samples`, with zero
`speaker_dropped_samples` for a paced run.

These checks establish microphone AAC on both paths and recorded audio reaching the speaker driver. They do not
establish intelligibility, loudness or echo quality: listen through your own client for that.
