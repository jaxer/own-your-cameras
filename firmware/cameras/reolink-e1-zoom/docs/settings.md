# Runtime settings

Every setting is a Home Assistant entity of the `cam_<id>` device (`entity_category: config`,
[home-assistant.md](home-assistant.md)), command
`camera/<id>/<key>/set` (non-retained), retained state `camera/<id>/<key>/state` reporting the
**applied** value. Out-of-range or malformed payloads are rejected with a log line and change nothing.
The schema is one table, `cam::settings::specs()` (plus the picture items in `cam::isp_iq::ITEMS`); file
parsing, payload validation, HA discovery and the table below all derive from it (a host test keeps
this table identical to the code).

Cross-field rules: `ir_to_night` > `ir_to_day`; `ptz_start_speed` ≤ `ptz_speed`. A change that breaks
them is rejected; a file that breaks them loads both fields' defaults.

## Persistence

`/mnt/para/cam-settings.toml` (a RAM path, `/mnt/tmp/cam-settings.toml`, for `cam serve --diagnostic`),
written only by the daemon, mode 0600: temp file, `fsync`, rename, directory `fsync`.

- **Save window:** a change is written within 10 s of the **first** unsaved change and is never
  postponed by later changes, so a slider burst costs one write per 10 s and a power cut loses at most
  the last 10 s.
- Flushed on orderly shutdown and before an MQTT reboot. A failed write stays pending, is retried one
  window later and shows in the `settings` sensor.
- Absent file: first-run defaults. Unreadable/invalid file or field: that field's default, one log line,
  the diagnostic `settings` sensor reads `invalid: <keys>`; never a startup failure (three failed starts
  would hand the camera back to the vendor stack). Unknown keys are ignored, so a downgrade keeps working.
- First-run defaults from the stock `/mnt/para/0_isp.cfg` (read, never written): `mirror`, `flip` and
  the picture levels (`v·200/255`, hue rotated so 128 = 0°, `antiflick` 1 = 60 Hz).
- `cam preflight` does not require the file.

## Not exposed, and why

- AEC `filter_length`, `frame_size`, `lb_channel`: they size AEC buffers inside the `aec_max` envelope
  and have no audible value without a loopback route ([hardware/audio.md](hardware/audio.md)).
- Watchdog and health budgets: a wrong value resets the camera or masks a hung boot.
- Sub-stream parameters: the sub stream feeds every HA tile and stays 640×480 full-frame.
- Any non-4:3 or cropped main size: the main stream is always the full sensor frame scaled.
- Presets (named in `cam.toml`; `preset_save/set` saves a position, [home-assistant.md](home-assistant.md)),
  MQTT/Wi-Fi/RTSP credentials (they stay in the hand-written private files).

## Main stream: measured envelope and the stall guard

Measured on the tested unit: every size is the full 4:3 sensor frame (no crop; main and sub show the same
field of view). Changes restart the main path alone; the main stream's longest gap was 0.2 s (limit 2 s), and a
go2rtc stream of the main path followed every change by itself, including 2592×1944. Ring: the main path config is sized for 2592×1944 at
8.192 Mbit/s at startup (12.1 MiB ring), so a raise never re-opens it.

| Main | Main delivered | Sub stream (10 fps) |
|---|---|---|
| 1280×960 at 10–30 fps | as set | 10 fps |
| 1920×1440 at 5–15 fps | as set | 10 fps |
| 1920×1440 at 20 / 25 / 30 fps | as set | **0 / 5 / 0 fps** |
| 2592×1944 at 5–15 fps | as set, up to 8.2 Mbit/s | 10 fps |
| 2592×1944 at 20 fps | 10 fps | 10 fps |
| 2592×1944 at 25–30 fps | as set | 0 fps (camera reset before the guard) |

A sub stream that stops delivering trips the watchdog's 5 s encoder budget and resets the camera, and a
persisted value would repeat that every boot. So a main-stream change, and a non-stock persisted main
stream at boot, are on probation for 10 s: if either stream is silent for 2 s the media thread restores
the previous (at boot: stock) main stream, the `settings` sensor reports the refusal, and the store
saves what runs. Resolution and fps stay independent settings; combinations the encoders cannot
sustain are refused by measurement, not by a table. Highest sustained bitrate: 8.2 Mbit/s
(2592×1944 at 30 fps, before the sub stream's starvation was known).
